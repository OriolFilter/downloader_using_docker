## Things to do

- Script that uses megatools and gets a link as argument (simple shit) *can be done with python ngl*
- Docker image that contains megatools installed, might use arch or alpine
- Combine things I guess

## Start
### Script

https://amoffat.github.io/sh/

**Python**

- [ ] Receives link as argument 
> #### multiple links multiple commands? 
> like, for link in links: command(link)
> 
> maybe that but using threading?? (will overcap fast)

- [ ] Add the possibility of logging in using a mega account (to improve the download limit)
